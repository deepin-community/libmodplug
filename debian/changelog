libmodplug (1:0.8.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version
    * 0.8.8 introduced an ABI change without updating the major version.
      This was causing potential problems in clients linked against
      libmodplug0c2, including silence.

      This version changes the binary package from libmodplug0c2 to
      libmodplug1, so all related applications will have to be
      recompiled to use a version greater than is in Lenny (0.8.4).

      Closes: #588465
  * debian/copyright updated with additional contributors and the license
    description properly set to public domain

    number, which is not the same. (closes: #449893)

libmodplug (1:0.7-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * use source:Version for -dev package in debian/control for binNMU
    safety -- however, the originally submitted patch also wanted to
    change the relationship from = to >=, which I am _not_ doing, as it
    does not appear to be necessary. (closes: #437489)
  * Acknowledge Automake NMU (closes: #376456)
  * Acknowledge overflow NMU (closes: #383574)

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Aug 2007 21:45:46 -0400

libmodplug (1:0.7-5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Check for very large sample sizes that could create overflows, enabling an
    attacker to allocate zero bytes and possibly execute arbitrary codes as
    the user [CVE-2006-4192]. (Closes: #383574)
  * Run aclocal-1.9 instead of aclocal, as automake1.9 doesn't provide the
    latter; fixes FTBFS.

libmodplug (1:0.7-4.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Medium-urgency upload for RC bugfix.
  * Rebuild against g++-4.0 for the C++ ABI transition, renaming
    libmodplug0 to libmodplug0c2 and conflicting with libmodplug0.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jul 2005 19:10:24 -0700

libmodplug (1:0.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

libmodplug (1:0.7-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * NMU
  * debian/control: (Closes: #267204)
    - removed build-dependency on libxmms-dev, libglib2.0-dev;
    - libmodplug-dev now depends on libmodplug (= ${Source-Version})
  * debian/rules: enable CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, set to "-O2", so that the
    "-g" flag is inhibited. This makes the build slightly faster.

 -- Wolfgang Sourdeau <was@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Aug 2004 23:05:11 -0400

libmodplug (1:0.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Depends: libmodplug0, not Recommends.  This is breaking builds of a
    number of other packages, so the urgency is high.  (closes: #266794)
  * Standards-Version: 3.6.1.0 (no changes needed)
  * Deleted unneeded manpage template.

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 10:02:24 -0500

libmodplug (1:0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * libmodplug split off from modplugxmms
  * Epoch needed, as actual version of libmodplug is lower than the

  * Arch: any (removed hppa exclusion) (closes: #126985 again)
  * Add Conflicts/Replaces lines to debian/control for libmodplug0 and
    libmodplug-dev to allow clean upgrade from the NMU. (closes: #199840)
  * Added libmodplug_la_LIBADD = -lstdc++ to libmodplug/Makefile.am to
    force the module to be compiled against libstdc++ to correct some
    problems other programs may have linking against it (thanks to Sam
    Hocevar <sam@zoy.org> for this).

 -- Zed Pobre <zed@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jul 2003 10:10:36 -0500

modplugxmms (2.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (closes: #147604)
    - This is the first version that actually compiles properly with gcc
      3.x. (closes: #126985)
    - A new binary is included, modplugplay, that I have for now stowed
      in the xmms-modplug binary package.  Since this is a self-standing
      player, the Depends: xmms in xmms-modplug has been demoted to a
      Recommends.
  * ** WARNING FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED THE NMU VERSIONS (2.04-0.x) **
    - If you have created any files that have made use of libmodplug as
      provided in the NMU, be aware that the files are now in a different
      binary package (libmodplug0 and libmodplug-dev), and if you created
      any packages, your dependencies are now wrong.
    - I have not used any of the NMU code due to an absolute lack of any
      attempt at coordination with me on the part of the uploader.
      However, everything that was fixed there should be fixed here as
      well.
  * This version corrects endianness issues that were causing it
    to play nothing but noise on PowerPC (closes: #196941)
  * Backed out gcc/g++3.2 changes that I had started to make, since
    upstream seems to have taken care of things fairly well.
  * Backed out uint32 change in gui/main.cpp (no longer needed)
  * Edited modplugxmms/Makefile.am to force the libtool relinking to
    search the ../libtool/.libs directory for libmodplug.so.  This removes
    the circular build-dependency described below under the changes from
    2.02-1.
  * Fixed the Author(s) to Authors in debian/copyright
  * Changed build-dependency from libglib1.2-dev to libglib2.0-dev
    -- CHANGES FROM 2.03-1 (not uploaded) --
  * New upstream version.  This still does not compile.
  * Recommends: unzip, bzip2.  Note that the xmms-modplug may refuse to
    play some zip files created in MS Windows until they have been
    decompressed and recompressed with standard zip.
  * Removed emacs stuff from changelog
    -- CHANGES FROM 2.02-1 (not uploaded) --
  * New upstream version.  New upstream maintainer. (closes: #147604)
  * Supposedly works fine now under gcc 3.x.  It doesn't (tested against
    gcc/g++3.2, but it's different things breaking now than before).
    * modplugxmms/gui/main.cpp modified to use stringstream instead of
      strstream. -- Nope, backed out.  This would require changes to the
      headers as well that I will need more time to deal with.  I need
      someone else to help me do c++ cleanup, please.
  * modplugxmms/gui/main.cpp: counter i changed from uint32 to unsigned
    long int.  I'm surprised that it compiles for anyone without this.
  * libmodplug.so is a separate library built by the program that is
    required by the libmodplugxmms.so plugin to XMMS.  This library must
    be in /usr/lib at make install time, or libmodplugxmms will fail to
    build and install (though the make process does not abort with error,
    making it easy to miss).  I have split libmodplug out into separate
    lib and -dev packages.  Thanks to Joanne Hunter
    <jrhunter@menagerie.tf> for helping me figure this out.
    (closes: #190993)
  * The above introduces a circular build dependency, of a sort (and this
    has been entered into the Build-Depends) -- the package will
    successfully build without the libmodplug0 and libmodplug-dev packages
    installed, but it will create an xmms-modplug package with no plugin.
    If the libmodplug packages are then installed and the package is
    rebuilt, it will rebuild all packages correctly.  This may be
    correctable inside the main source, but I don't have time to work on
    it properly at the moment.  Patches welcome.
  * Noted the above in README.Debian.
  * This version correctly handles the .rar file that was crashing it
    before (closes: #148166)
  * This version will still crash if fed a .rar file when unrar is not
    installed.  I am tempted to remove .rar support entirely for this
    reason, since unrar is an egregiously non-free utility anyway, but I
    am leaving it in for now.

modplugxmms (2.04-0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU.
  * debian/control:
    + Added a build dependency on libglib2.0-dev so that we get the

modplugxmms (2.04-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU (RC bug more than one year old).
  * New upstream release (Closes: #147604).
    + Upstream fixed endianness issues for PPC (Closes: #196941).
    + Upstream fixed gcc3 builds (Closes: #126985).
  * debian/control:
    + Set policy to 3.5.10.
    + Build-depend on debhelper (>=2.0).
    + Added trailing slashes to URLs.
    + We recommend unzip and bzip2 because they are needed to uncompress some
      module formats.
    + Ditto for unrar, but we merely suggest it since it is non-free.
  * debian/rules:
    + Set prefix to /usr everywhere to fix installation issues.
    + Added a call to dh_makeshlibs.
    + Removed the override file.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Replaced "Author(s)" with "Author".
  * Removed spurious debian/manpage.sgml.ex file.

modplugxmms (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Upstream maintainer is looking for someone to
    take over development from him, so if you have an interest in this
    package, send him e-mail at temporal@gauge3d.org.
  * PowerPC patches have been integrated upstream.
  * Integrated a few C++ fixes to make a slight dent in the g++-3.0 build
    failures.  Unfortunately, the code makes extensive use of procbuf.h,
    which has gone away with g++-3.0, so I'm removing hppa from the arch
    list for now and downgrading the bug.  Someone will need to port this
    section to g++-3.0, which is more than I have time or skill for.
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.6 (no changes needed)
  * Problem with DESTDIR not being handled correctly fixed upstream;
    workaround removed in debian/rules.  Unfortunately, libmodplug.so is
    now being dumped in /usr/lib instead of /usr/lib/xmms/Input, so it
    has to be moved in the debian/rules install target.
  * I originally packaged this back in March, but because the resulting so
    file was not visible to XMMS, it was never uploaded.

  * Applied patches from Adam Goode <adam@evdebs.org> to get it working on
    PowerPC (closes: #95221).  Thanks Adam!  Sorry for the delay.
  * Call aclocal, automake, autoconf after libtoolize -f to get a correct
    configure script.  Add automake and autoconf to Build-Depends.
  * Do $(MAKE) distclean before removing specific files to make sure we

modplugxmms (1.3a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libtoolize -f to debian/rules to update config.guess,
    config.sub, ltconfig, and ltmain.sh to fix ARM/HURD breakage (those
    files are now removed on clean) (closes: #78669)
  * Moved to DH_COMPAT=2
  * Moved override.Lintian to /usr/share/lintian/overrides/xmms-modplug
  * Removed extraneous /usr/bin and /usr/sbin directories
  * Thanks to Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org> for the patches for the last
    two entries.
  * Added a watch file
  * Removed a number of example files from the debian/ directory that I
    figured I probably wouldn't need to keep for this package.
  * Added a note to README.Debian about having to disable the XMMS default
    modplayer plugin before this one will work.

modplugxmms (1.3a-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added xmms-dev and libglib1.2-dev (this is weird, since the configure
    script uses glib-config to set an include path for glib, but the
    module doesn't link to it).  Closes: #72576
